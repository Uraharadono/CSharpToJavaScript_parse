# CSharp (C#) class(es) to various JavaScript classes/functions 

This project is predecessor of [this project](https://github.com/Uraharadono/CSharpClassToJavaScript_runtime).


## Details
This version started out as implementation of idea behind automatic conversion of classes, but I found out in some cases It becomes limiting in term of what it can done.
Main issue with it is that it is generating stuff by parsing file content as string, which is very limiting when more complex functionalities are being implemented.

But after all it still does what it is made for right now.
I have plans to continue maintaining it, but more attention will be given to its big brother.
